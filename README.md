# 7segment-clock
Clock made from 7 segment display and DS3231
A simple clock made from 6x 7 Segment display and DS3231 rtc module.
First I made the prototype on an Arduino board then just to make it cleaner I just pulled the IC ( Atmega328P) off UNO and placed it on breadboard. Added 16 MHz external oscillator and a LM2596 power regulator ( 12V to 5V ).

Markup : * Plans for V2.0
            * Clear code
            * Push buttons on breadboard to set time of rtc.
            * Since ds3231 supports alarm functionality explore that. May be add ESP8266 to set alarm wirelessly and sync time too.
